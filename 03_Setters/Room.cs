      -  We also would like to include some constants that the define a minimum and maximum length, width, and height.
      -  When setting the properties, make sure to compare the values to the min/max and only set them if the value is valid.

      -  Bonus:
        Create a method that calculates total lateral surface area.
        Only allow the properties to be set from inside the class itself.
        Throw an exception if the given value is outside the permitted range.
